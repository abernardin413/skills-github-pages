This is a training blog as I learn how to use GitHub. I'm using GitHub as a way to learn more coding, such as C# and SQL. These are two languages that I use at work in our ERP system, called Epicor. I want to be able
to create better dashboard, queries, etc. within Epicor for the Epicor users within my workplace.
